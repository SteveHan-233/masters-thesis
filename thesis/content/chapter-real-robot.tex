\chapter{Real-Robot Experiments}

In this chapter, I introduce the details of how our experiments are conducted on the real robot. 
However, due to the complexity of the robot system, I need to first describe the infrastructure I built for collecting demonstrations and deploying the neural network policy. Specifically, I had build a real-time system to integrate the camera, grippers, whole-body controller, and the VR headset.
